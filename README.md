- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @MaddoJP // Marko Z.
- M.Sc. Biotechnology
- Data Engineer at Roche Diagnostics GmbH, responsible for two OsiSoft PI Systems at Munich Site as SystemManager 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue.js, C#, Java
- My programming story:
  While Corona pandemic, our lab was completely shut down.
  Therefore, I've started to learn and teach myself coding.
  In order to learn more about programming, I took a break from work and completed a four month internship at iits-consulting.
  Afterwards, I've decided to change my career path and switched from wetlab to more IT-related activities within Roche.
